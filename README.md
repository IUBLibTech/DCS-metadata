# DWIM - Digitization Workflow Information Manager

Metadata schemas and tools to support digitization workflows

DWIM also means "Do What I Mean" -- this DWIM should try to do what the 
human operator would do by default.

Discarded name choices included:  "deathworm", "deworm", "dewworm", and "dwalm". 


## HONKING BIG DISCLAIMER
This is really just a pie-in-the-sky proof of concept / thought experiment
kind of thing.  Its origins are likely related to a sleepless night after 
eating junk food right before I went to bed.  Curse you, Voortman vanilla 
wafers!

## Background

We have four major areas where we digitize content:
* Digitization Services:
    * Time-based media - uses the MDPI workflow tools
    * Image-based media - uses ImageProc and varous scripts
* BDPL for born-digital content - uses manual processes and scripts
* IULMIA for film - this is a new workflow that is TBD

### General Workflow Overview

All of our digitization workflows follow the same overall structure:
* Someone requests some things to get digitized and delivers the physical media
  along with some documentation describing the metadata, etc.
* The digitization specialist will...
    * prepare the media for digitization, which may include cleaning/repair
    * digitize the media and verify it looks or sounds "right"
    * process metadata is recorded (even if it is "this one is done")
    * the files are pushed to a server somewhere
    * return the materials to the requester
* Automated systems will...
    * run some technical QC checks
    * create derivatives (as needed)
    * distribute the derivatives (as needed)
    * store the data in a preservation / archive system

### Difficulties with the current approach

Right now the processes that we use for digitization, processing, distribution,
packaging, and metadata collection vary greatly between different projects,
media types, and sometimes within the same project.  Most of this is because
we've created one-off processes that were specific to the need at hand and they
became the "go to" system for far longer than the project's lifespan.

Additionally, most of our workflows are centered around each
physical object (PO) individually, rather than around the
intellectual object (IO) as a whole.


## Goals

Ideally we should have a human- and machine-readable record of how physical
media became a digital object that can be stored with the object in a 
preservation system for future reference.

## Scope
This primarily focused on these areas:
* Describing the structure of the physical media components comprising 
  the intellectual object
    * order and description of the physical media
    * purpose of the physical media ("performance program", and the like)
* Description of the physical media
    * Physical description (type, size, length, media vendor, etc)
    * Information required for successful playback (speed, groove size, etc)
* Conservation concerns
    * Inspection details (warping, damage, fungus, etc)
    * Conservation actions (baking, freezing, cleaning, etc)
* Digitization information
    * Equipment setup details (software configuration, signal chains, etc)
    * Basic information of the produced files (duration, color space, etc)
* Processing / Packaging / Distribution Information
    * Provide hints to derivative creation (such as "audio is on stream 3")
    * Override any automated QC checks for special cases
    * defer distribution to an access/preservation system, etc.
    * Processing logs, qc checks, etc will be collected

This information is explicitly **not in scope** except to support the 
functionality above:
* Descriptive metadata
    * Only the bare minimum metadata is used to identify the physical media
    * Identifiers can be included to refer to the system of record
* Ownership / Access control
    * Only supporting communicating with the owner and returning media
    * TBD:  processing hints?
* Details about the content
    * Only information relevant to creating/playing the digital copy is 
      allowed, such as "audio volume is low on source" but not "speech begins 
      at 3 minutes"

Details of the human workflow for digitization, such as project management or
tools used, are not prescriptive -- they are intended to be illustrative of
how in-scope functionality could fit into the bigger picture or to provide an 
example of how one could include this functionality.

The first pass of this concept is targeted directly at AV and Film digitization
since there is a desire to retire the MDPI workflow tools and IULMIA will be
adding a new Film scanner in the coming months.


## Metadata File Format
The files used for storing metadata will be YAML.  The decision
to use this format is detailed in [Why YAML](docs/why_yaml.md)

Where possible, the YAML files should be validated against a
JSON schema for structural correctness and logically validated
when processing.


## Intellectual Object Filesystem Layout

Each IO will be given a organizationally unique identifier.  These can be
barcodes, VA numbers, etc.  This ID will be used as the folder that 
contains all of the metadata, POs, and sidecar files that make up the
IO.







## Digitization Workflow Process

NOTE:  Any YAML examples here are based on the schema as it exists at the time
this was written.  The schemas will change as more details are fleshed out.


### The request
A request for digitization should include information about the intellectual
object(s) that need to be digitized.  In addition to basic metadata (such as
title), these things should be present (if possible):
* Identifiers for the intellectual object, such as IUCAT barcode, catkey,
  call number, or a locally-scoped identifier (i.e. something off the 
  spreadsheet)
* Information about the physical objects which make up the intellectual object
  including indentification information (such as label text or barcode), and
  an indication which order multiple objects should be presented.  For example,
  "the tape labeled '342' should be first, 'a13' should be second".  
  Additionally, if there are any missing items, they should be identified 
  ("part 3 is missing")
* The media to be digitized :)

The example will be a simple one:
* title: "A beginner's guide to potato hubandry", author: "t. uber"
* a single audiocassette with a case labeled "potato"
* call number SB211.P8 B56

### Set up a project environment
Every digitization project will need an ID -- it could be a VA number or some
other identifier.  We'll use `VZZ9999` as the ID.

The person doing the digitization will create a project directory in whatever
workspace is assigned.  For an AV digitization, the space is on capybara and
the directory will be named the same as the identifier.  So the directory is
also named `VZZ9999`

A skeleton digitization metadata file is copied into the workspace which a
name that includes the identifier.  The skeleton would be saved as 
`VZZ9999-project.yaml` and look something like this:

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=schemas/core.json
version: dcs-digitization-workflow-metadata@v1
project_information:
  id: 
  request_date: 
  completion_date: 
  contacts:
    - name: 
      email: 
  notes: No Notes
descriptive_metadata:
  title: 
  author: 
  identifiers:
    - 
constituents:
  - label: 
    physical_media_description: 
```
and filling out the bits from the project request:

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=schemas/core.json
version: dcs-digitization-workflow-metadata@v1
project_information:
  id: VZZ9999
  request_date: 2024-07-16
  completion_date: 
  contacts:
    - name: Brian Wheeler
      email: bdwheele@iu.edu
  notes: No Notes
descriptive_metadata:
  title: A beginner's guide to potato hubandry
  author: t. tuber
  identifiers:
    - call_number: SB211.P8 B56
constituents:
  - label: potato
    physical_media_description: 
```
The completion date remains empty and the label for the first constituent object
has been set ("potato").


### Digitizing the Object

The physical media is an audiocassette, so moving the cursor below the 
physical_media_description field and indenting, CTRL-space lets us select
the audiocassette information

![image](docs/audiocassette.png)

Selecting it extends the file appropriately:

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=schemas/core.json
version: dcs-digitization-workflow-metadata@v1
project_information:
  id: VZZ9999
  request_date: 2024-07-16
  completion_date: 
  contacts:
    - name: Brian Wheeler
      email: bdwheele@iu.edu
  notes: No Notes
descriptive_metadata:
  title: A beginner's guide to potato hubandry
  author: t. tuber
  identifiers:
    - call_number: SB211.P8 B56
constituents:
  - label: potato
    physical_media_description: 
      media_type: Audiocassette
      position: 1
      cassette_type: 
      tape_type: 
      tape_stock_brand: 
      format_duration: 
      conservation_concerns:
        pack_deformation: None
        damaged_tape: false
        damaged_shell: false
        fungus: false
        soft_binder_syndrome: false
        other_contaminants: false
        remediation_notes: No Remediation
      sequences:
        - id: 
          tape_speed: "1.875ips"
          noise_reduction: Unknown
          sound_field: 
          duration: 
          notes: No Notes
```

There's only one tape, so the position '1' is correct.  The tape overall tape
information is noted:

```
    physical_media_description: 
      media_type: Audiocassette
      position: 1
      cassette_type: Compact
      tape_type: I
      tape_stock_brand: Scotch
      format_duration: 90 min
      conservation_concerns:
        pack_deformation: None
        damaged_tape: false
        damaged_shell: true
        fungus: false
        soft_binder_syndrome: false
        other_contaminants: false
        remediation_notes: Taped the shell together
```

The digitization for side 1 is performed using industry-standard tools and 
settings are noted:
```
        - id: side 1
          tape_speed: "1.875ips"
          noise_reduction: Unknown
          sound_field: stereo
          duration: 22:30
          notes: Recurring popping on the left channel
```
and the media file is named appropriately and put into the project directory.

Side 2 is handled similarly

The digitizer will do any visual/listening QC work to make sure the content is
what is expected.

Now the digitization is complete and the "completion_date" field is filled out.

TBD:  
* mapping objects and sequences to filenames, and filename conventions 
  generally.  Maybe the names are literally specified in the sequence itself?
* need some place to hang signal chain information
* need a place to put who did the digitization

### Processing the object

When the digitization is finished the project directory is moved to a processing
dropbox.

The processing system will look at the project file and:
* validate the project file, both against the schema and for consistency
* make sure all the files are there
* do any format-specific automatic QC for the file formats
